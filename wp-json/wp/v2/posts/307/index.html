First, let&#8217;s break down these tools into categories based on how I use them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The first category includes tools like <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/UUgloGXGZws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SciSpace<\/a><\/strong>, LitMaps, and Scite. These tools assist with literature reviews, helping you find and analyse research papers for your projects. They make the process of reviewing literature much more efficient and manageable.<\/p>\n<p>The second category consists of tools where you can upload a PDF. For instance, you can use SciSpace, Claude AI, Chat PDF, or even Adobe Acrobat, which recently introduced a similar feature. These tools allow you to interact with your documents in a more dynamic way, making it easier to work with large amounts of text.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about what I refer to as the &#8220;grey zone&#8221; of AI tools. I use this term because I cannot fully endorse the use of these tools. Many students and researchers might praise them, but I strongly advise caution. Universities currently lack clear regulations regarding the use of AI tools, especially those that claim to &#8220;humanise&#8221; AI-generated text. Examples of such tools include Undetectable AI, Hix AI, Bypass AI etc.<\/p>\n<p>I tested Undetectable AI and similar tools a few months ago and found the results to be not desired. I do not use them for my academic or personal work, such as blogging. While these tools might be useful for tasks like blogging, where you can use AI-generated content as a starting point and then heavily edit it, I have issues with the term &#8220;humanise.&#8221; These tools often introduce artificial spelling errors, strange spacing, and other flaws into the text, requiring significant editing afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>So, while they might claim to make the text seem more human, the quality of the content is compromised. Additionally, if you take this &#8220;humanised&#8221; text and run it through another tool like Originality AI, it might not detect it as AI-generated. However, the content remains not desired, which is why I do not recommend using these tools for any serious work.<\/p>\n<p>Many people might be using these tools, but relying on them blindly can ruin your academic work. Tools like TurnItIn can easily identify AI-written content, and universities will likely adopt even more powerful tools in the future. According to AI tool creators I have spoken to, there is currently no tool on the market that can perfectly humanise or detect AI-generated text with 100% accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are a student or an evaluator, I do not recommend using tools that claim to humanise or detect AI-generated text. These are my thoughts on what I call the &#8220;gray zone&#8221; of AI tools. I would love to hear your opinions and experiences with these tools.<\/p>\n<h3>Watch Video Tutorial:<\/h3>\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DON&#039;T Use These AI Tools Blindly\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/H_4bUUkr85c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this post I&#8217;d like to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":309,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"default","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"default","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"set","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-4)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"footnotes":""},"categories":[5],"tags":[95,94,8],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/307"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=307"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/307\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":310,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/307\/revisions\/310"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/309"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=307"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=307"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vugarpro.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=307"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
